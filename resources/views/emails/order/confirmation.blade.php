<p>We just wanted to confirm that your student is signed up for Passion Camp 2017! It is going to be an amazing week that your student will never forget. We will be in touch with more details at the end of May. Please remember that your final payment is due May 1st.</p>

<p>ALL Summer Camp forms are due two weeks after you register your student.</p>

<p><em>*Note: If your student went to Winter Wknd, all you need to do is fill out the Passion Camp Waiver . The PCC form is good for all of 2017. You will receive an email from DOCUSIGN for the Passion City Church form. The waiver for Passion Camp will come separately. BOTH forms are required for participation this week.</em></p>

<p>Space is limited, so please encourage any other students you want to join to sign up quickly!</p>

<p>If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to email our team at students@passioncitychurch.com.</p>

<p>Passion Students meets every Sunday: Middle School at 11:45a/High School at 3:45p. We would love for your student to join us!</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing everyone in Daytona!<br />
The Passion Students Team</p>
